Crown Sweeper v0.1.0 beta
=========================

This tool is designed to facilitate sweeping masternode and systemnode
rewards. It can also be used any time you want to exercise control over
which "coins" are used in a particular send operation. 

## Background
Over time node rewards, especially for operators of multiple nodes, can
accumulate in numbers so large that even using coin control in the GUI
wallet it is not trivial to consolidate them. The sweeper can be run
when using either daemon or GUI wallet and provides hybrid functionality
between coin control and the "spendfrom" command line tool.

## Installation
- Download the artifact for your platform.
- unzip it using your preferred unzip utility. 
**Note** that Github artifacts download as dynamically created zip
files. Unfortunately this **strips the execute permission bit from 
linux/OSX executables**. After unzipping the artifact you must manually
restore the execute permission by

    ```chmod +x dist/CrownSweeper```
- move or copy the executable to your preferred location
 
## Operation
Upon execution a window is displayed showing all the wallet addresses
containing unlocked Unspent Transaction Outputs ( 
[UTXOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output) 
), the total amount of CRW in each address, the label/account attached
to each address and the number of UTXOs in each.

One or more addresses may be selected by clicking on them. The sum
available in those addresses is displayed and entered by default in the
"Amount" box. The amount can be overridden if the user chooses. The "To"
address can be entered manually, a new address in the same wallet
generated automatically, or one of the from addresses can be copied as
the destination. 

The "Upto" checkbox serves two functions:
* It indicates that fees are included in the sent amount (ie: the
received amount will be smaller than shown by at least the fees amount)
* It indicates that a transaction should be generated even if the total
value of the available UTXOs which will fit within the transaction size
limit is less than the required amount.

If "Upto" is not checked then the fee is additional to the amount to
send, and the value in the selected addresses must be greater than the
sum of amount and fee. Any change will be sent to the first used from
address.  

The fee defaults to 0.025 CRW. You may choose a smaller or larger (upto
1% of the transaction value) amount.

After selecting the inputs and setting the receiving address, amount and
fee, hit "Sweep" and the transaction will be generated. If successfully
broadcast the transaction id will be displayed and the UTXO list
refreshed. If the generate/broadcast fails the reason why will be shown
instead.

Transactions are limited in size to 250KB (about 1600 UTXOs) and in
value up to the available funds. You may need to perform more than one
sweep if the amount to send cannot be accommodated in a single
transaction.
